[dev] H5 Text Style Updates

Move the h5 HTML tags into a component. This will allow us to make
changes in a single location for more general changes to the tag. This
also allows for conditional formatting of the text based on the style
attribute. This is only for italics currently.

H5 component leverages the text-style-h5 style defined with SCSS
