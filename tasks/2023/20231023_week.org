Log in to https://valdera.lightning.force.com/
This will trigger that an update of the password is needed.
Last Pass has a password generator tool
https://www.lastpass.com/features/password-generator
You will want to set it for:
* Password Length 20
* Uppercase
* Lowercase
* Numbers

DO NOT set the symbols. Some symbols break the login as they are not escaped
correctly and cause problems on the command line

Make sure to copy password as you will need it for other steps

After putting the password into the two spots, you will be logged in to SF
This will generate an email that will be sent to salesforce-prod@valdera.com
google group. In that message you will be given a security token

With these two pieces of data you can update the functions to call SF

First open up the `internal-backend` git project locally
Run `firebase use prod`
Next run `firebase functions:secrets:set SF_PASSWORD`
When prompted, copy the password that you generated with Last Pass
This will take time to update

Next run `firebase functions:secrets:set SF_SECURITY_TOKEN`
When prompted, copy the value that was taken from the email that was sent to
salesforce-prod@valdera.com
This will take time to update
